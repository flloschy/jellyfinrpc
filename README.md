# Local and Server-side Jellyfin Discord RPC

Support for Music, Movies and Episodes.

You need to have deno and npm installed.

You need to know your discord token in order to run it on the server. Running Server-side does not support images.
 
Takes 10 seconds to start. Updates every 4 seconds. If no Activity is detected goes to idle and only checks once a minute. If Connection is lost takes 1.5 minutes to reconnect.

You need a Jellyfin server (duh)

Just run `makeItWorkAlready.sh`

> Personal Project -> No promise for support or function promise.
